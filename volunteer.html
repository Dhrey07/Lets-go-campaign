          Volunteers are the heart of our organization. Let’s Go Campaign is
          structured to provide service opportunities and operate through the
          work of volunteers. Our volunteers are fundamental to the success of
          our organization. They work with the team in providing help and
          services to those in need, and help us achieve our purpose.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether you can volunteer once a week, once a month or once a year;
          individually or with a group of friends, family or colleagues,
          whatever your commitment, every hour of assistance helps us ensure
          those in need will in their time of need have the required assistance
          and our ultimate goal is to provide the best possible volunteer
          experience and prepare our volunteers to become advocates for help in
          their communities.
          <br />
          <br />
          When you donate your time to Let’s Go Campaign, you become a partner
          in the fight against crisis around the world.
